This application will interactively assist you in creating a prediction model for a quality score of an exercise session, based on sensor data.  Accuracy, training time, and confusion matrix information are presented to you on the tabs.

Source for this application can be found at https://github.com/angra311/c-dp

The data used is from the Human Activity Recognigion project.  More detail about this project and the dataset used can be found at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

The tabs on this panel guide you through the process.  

* The "Cleaning" tab interactively shows the results of data cleaning operations as you change settings in the data cleaning options panel, left.
* The "Recursive Partionining" tab interactively shows the results of building a recursive partitioning prediction model from the cleaned dataset, when selected to the left.
* The "Random Forest" tab shows the results of building a random forest model.  To build the random forest model, select "Build random forest model" to the left, set the options given, and click the "Execute" button.
